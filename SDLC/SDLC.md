# Day 1 - DevOps Learning Journey

## Topic: Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Today I learned about **SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**.  
It is a process that consists of several phases which teams follow before delivering software.

### Phases of SDLC
1. **Planning** → Gathering the requirements.  
2. **Defining** → Documenting the requirements (e.g., sales documents, requirement docs).  
3. **Designing** → Creating designs at two levels:  
   - **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Overall system architecture.  
   - **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Detailed design of components.  
   - Also includes defining how the application should look.  
4. **Building** → Developing or coding the application.  
5. **Testing** → Testing the application to ensure it works as expected.  
6. **Deployment & Monitoring** → Deploying the application into production and monitoring it.

### How DevOps Fits into SDLC
As a **DevOps Engineer**, the role is to **speed up and improve the SDLC process** by:  
- Automating **build**  
- Automating **testing**  
- Automating **deployment**  

This makes the whole software delivery faster and more reliable.
