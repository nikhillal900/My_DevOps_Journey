### 2. Why do we need DevOps?
- **Before DevOps (10+ years ago):**  
  - Software delivery used to take **6 months to 1 year**.  
  - Separate teams: Build & Release Engineers, System Administrators, Server Admins, Testers.  
  - Manual processes → slow, error-prone, and costly.  

- **With DevOps:**  
  - Faster delivery → sometimes within **hours or a day**.  
  - Automation reduces manual errors.  
  - Better collaboration between teams.  
  - Ensures **high quality, frequent, and reliable releases**.  

✅ **Advantages of DevOps:**  
- Faster time to market  
- Improved product quality  
- Continuous feedback and monitoring  
- Reduced costs and risks  
- Better collaboration & culture
